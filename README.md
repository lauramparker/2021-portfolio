Title: Personal Portfolio Website

Description: 
    This project contains the website for my personal bio and development portfolio. The intent of the site is to promote my development portfolio and share relevant career experience (for the purpose of finding and securing employment opportunities as a web developer).  The site utilizes Bootstrap components and utilities to create a consistent layout on each page that is reponsive to different viewport sizes.  All 3 pages have a consistent navigation bar "navbar" from Bootstrap, frequent use of padding and margin utlities, and specific compponents relevant for that page (see details below).
    
    The site contains 3 discreet pages and affiliated image assets:

    1) About Me (bio, contact info) - 1 image asset

        Includes floated image and text, and Bootstrap "card" component for contact info

    2) Portfolio Page - 5 image assets

        Includes 5 square images 

    3) Contact form

        Includes Bootstrap "form" component for user to contact me with a message and user contact info



Installation:
    To run the development environment, clone the repository found at https://github.com/lparker78/responsive-portfolio_BootCamp2. Here you will find 3 html files (index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html) and 6 image assets.

Usage:
    Use this project as a beginner's example of a multi-page site with image assets. The code is a good introduction to using Bootstrap components and utilities.
