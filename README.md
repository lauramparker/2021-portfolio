# responsive-portfolio_BootCamp2

Title: Personal Portfolio Website

Description: 
    This project contains the website for my personal bio and development portfolio. The intent of the site is to promote my development portfolio and share relevant career experience (for the purpose of finding and securing employment opportunities as a web developer).
    
    The site contains 3 discreet pages and affiliated image assets:

    1) About Me (bio, contact info) - 1 image asset
    
    2) Portfolio Page - 5 image assets

    3) Contact form

Installation:
    To run the development environment, clone the repository found at https://github.com/lparker78/responsive-portfolio_BootCamp2. Here you will find 3 html files (index.html, contact.html, portfolio.html) and 6 image assets.

Usage:
    Use this project as a beginner's example of a multi-page site with image assets. The code is a good introduction to using Bootstrap components and utilities.
